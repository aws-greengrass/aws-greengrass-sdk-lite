# AWS Greengrass SDK Lite

The `aws-greengrass-sdk-lite` provides an API for making AWS IoT Greengrass IPC
calls with a small footprint. It enables Greengrass components to interact with
the Greengrass Nucleus (Lite or Classic) with less binary overhead and also
supports components written in C. Greengrass components can use this SDK as an
alternative to the `aws-iot-device-sdk-cpp-v2` or other language-specific device
SDKs.
